The Scope class can be used by any container that will store sets of variables.

Here are some examples of usage:

Class Instance:

		- parentScope should be the template for the class
		- isStatic should be false

Class Template:

		- parentScope should be the global scope, or the parent class template for inheritence
		- isStatic should be true

Generic Scope (Functions, etc):

		- parentScope should be the global scope, or the scope this was created in
		- isStatic should be false
		-When a child scope is destroyed, parent.overwriteVariables(child) should be called so parent variables are updated
